# 🖱️ Virtual Mouse 🌟

With Virtual Mouse, you can turn your webcam into a magic wand that moves your cursor and clicks away with just a flick of your wrist. Impress your friends, annoy your cat, and maybe even revolutionize how you interact with your computer. 🐱💻

## How It Works
It works by just making closing your index finger on top of your thumb. Though this is click if you are going to use it please give me some credit and have fun.

Virtual Mouse is powered by the magic of computer vision and the wonders of Python. Here's how to get started:

1. **Install Dependencies** 🛠️
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
   - Install the necessary libraries by running:
     ```
     pip install mediapipe, opencv-python, PyAutoGUI
     
     ```

2. **Run the Code** 🚀
   - Fire up your webcam and execute the script.
   - Move your hand around to control the cursor and make gestures to click, scroll, or perform other magical actions.

3. **Have Fun!** 🎈
   - Explore the possibilities! Wave goodbye to your traditional mouse and embrace the future of gesture-based computing.
   - Feel free to tweak the code, add your own gestures, or even integrate it into your projects.
